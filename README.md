# smile_mss_activity 😃

Microservice for activity management in [Smile 2024](https://smile.maua.br/) project for Mauá Institute of Technology.

## The Project 📽

### Introduction and Objectives ⁉

The project aims to create a system that will be used by the anyone to join Smile 2024 by Mauá Institute of Technology to enroll in activity, such as: courses, workshops, events, etc.

### Clean Architecture 🧼🏰

The purpose of the project is to learn and create a Clean Architecture for microservices stateless with AWS Lambda which is a way of structuring
the code in layers, each of which has a
specific responsibility. This architecture is based on the principles of SOLID and books like "Clean Architecture: A
Craftsman's Guide to Software Structure and Design" by Robert C. Martin.

To develop this project we used [clean_mss_template](https://github.com/Maua-Dev/clean_mss_template) as a base, which is a template for creating microservices with clean architecture.
